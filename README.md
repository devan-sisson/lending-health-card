# Lending Health Card

_Bootstrapped with `create-react-app`_

## What did I learn?

* there is a pseudo selector called `:last-of-type` that allows you to add styles to the last element in a list of things.

* create button groups with flex box and pseudo selectors `:first-child` and `:last-child`

* how to implement css grids (need to learn)


## What was I curious about and didn't have time to look into, or things that I didn't have time to implement?

* Namespacing styled components
